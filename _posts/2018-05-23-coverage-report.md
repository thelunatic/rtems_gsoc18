Hello Everyone !

In this second week of the project I want to show the generated 
coverage analysis report.

Please see the code section for instructions to run the coverage analysis.

In this post I'll only be posting picture of the the coverage analysis 
as explaining each component is currently beyond the scope of this blog,
however, I can make an attempt of describing the analysis report in detail 
later ( towards the end of the summer or maybe after the Completion of GSoC.

##### Running coverage on samples/ for score 

##### The main report.html with the analysis report:
